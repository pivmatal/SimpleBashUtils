GREP(1)                       User Commands                       GREP(1)

NAME
       grep, egrep, fgrep - print lines that match patterns

SYNOPSIS
       grep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -e PATTERNS ... [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -f PATTERN_FILE ... [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
grep  searches  for  PATTERNS  in  each  FILE.  PATTERNS is one or
patterns separated by newline characters,  and  grep  prints  each
line that matches a pattern.

A  FILE  of  “-”  stands for standard input.  If no FILE is given,
recursive searches examine the working directory, and nonrecursive
searches read standard input.

In  addition, the variant programs egrep and fgrep are the same as
grep -E and grep -F, respectively.  These variants are deprecated,
but are provided for backward compatibility.
